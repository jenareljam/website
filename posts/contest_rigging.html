							<h2>How to Rig an Online Contest</h2>
							<h5>May 3, 2016</h5>
							<p>
							<b>
								Ethics alert! <br/>
								Note that I did not actually rig this contest. My
								number of submissions was strictly less than the allowed number
								over the course of the contest.  What follows is an
								intellectual exercise in practical security with a discussion
								of better methods for detection and preventing this kind of
								attack in the future.<br/>
								I also redacted all the identifying materials I could to
								preserve the relative anonymity of the company hosting this
								contest.
							</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Last night, my Mom emailed me a link to a local garden center
								contest in which she had entered a cute photo.  The photos with
								the most votes at the end of the week would receive a gift
								card to the garden center running the contest, and the winning
								photo would be featured on their Facebook page.

							<p>
							After voting for my Mom's photo (you can tell which it is because
							it's the cutest), I did what virutally anyone would do and
							refreshed the page, then clicked "vote" again. Sadly, this time,
							I was met with a message that my vote could not be accepted
							because I already voted.

							<p>
							So, being the curious soul I am, I wanted to know exactly what
							mechanism they were using to detect duplicate votes and prevent
							cheating. 
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Attempt #1</b><br/>
							Opened a Chrome incognito window to clear cookies. See if they're
							simply doing a cookie check (which, since the client can modify
							the cookies, could be easily bypassed). Nope. Still can't vote a
							second time.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Attempt #2</b><br/>
							Maybe they're using a combination of IP address and user-agent or
							other request properties, so that multiple users at the same
							residence can vote once-per-day, each.  Opened the page in
							Firefox (incognito, for good measure), still couldn't vote again.
							Just to be sure, I also borrowed my wife's computer (a mac), and
							couldn't vote from her computer either.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Attempt #3</b><br/>
							Maybe they're filtering purely based on IP address.  Set up a SSH
							SOCKS proxy to a machine at work and configured Firefox to use
							it.  Boom. Vote accepted. So, it appears each IP address gets one
							vote per day. If, hypothetically, you had the ability to acquire
							lots of IP addresses (say, by spawning
							multiple VMs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_l3_c">Amazon EC2</a>),
							you could vote as many times as you wanted.
							</p>
							<p>
							First step, automate it.<br/>
							<b>curl</b> is a nice command-line tool that allows us to make
							arbitrary web requests, so let's use curl to emulate a browser
							visiting the site. First, let's take a look at what Chrome does
							when it visits the site legitimately.
							</p>

								<figcaption>Looking at the request headers from Chrome's developer console (F12).</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							At least initially, Chrome makes a standard HTTP request to the
							<redacted>/contests/ page.
							</p>

								<figcaption>Looking at the response headers from Chrome's developer console (F12).</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Looks like the page sets some cookies when we visit it. Any
							future requests to the site will include those cookies, so we too
							should record and replay those cookies with any later requests.
							</p>

								<figcaption>Emulating a browser's first request of the page.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							The above curl command will store any cookies in the HTTP
							Response into a new file called cookie.jar. We can then use them
							for later requests.
							</p>
							<p>
							Next, let's see what happens when we click the "Vote" button.
							</p>

							<p>
							A POST request gets sent to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the content 
							"action=contest_submit&ampcontest=11841&ampcontestant=&ltredacted&gt",
							where <b>contest</b> matches a field on the original page, and
							<b>contestant</b> matches the photo we're voting for (the cutest one).
							</p>
							<p>
							We can <i>probably</i> safely hardcode the contestant value, but
							let's actually parse the resulting webpage from our first request
							to dynamically find the contest id.  Who knows, maybe they change
							it every 24 hours and that's their mechanism for once-per-day.
							</p>

								<figcaption>Turning this into a bash script. I prefer python to awk.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							In the above code, we're now taking our curl command, piping it
							into a python script that performs a regex search for the
							parameter 'data-contest-id="11841"' and storing the value 11841
							into the variable <i>contest</i>.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="700px" src="/img/posts/contest_rigging/curl_post.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							All we have to do is submit the POST request with curl and we can
							vote from the command line.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="600px" src="/img/posts/contest_rigging/running_vote.png" />
								<figcaption>Fail.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Success!<br/>
							Now, we have a way to submit votes, but because it's checking our IP
							address between subsequent votes, we need to make the request from
							another IP address.
							</p>
							<p>
							Let's do it with a 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS proxy</a>
							and SSH. 
							</p>
							<figure>

							<p>
							First, we set up our tunnel to another machine we own.

							Next, we update the curl commands to use the new SOCKS proxy.
							</p>

							<p>
							Finally, we rerun the script to vote. This time, it works!
							</p>
							<p>
							This works great, but can we take it a step further? I can go on 
							Amazon's EC2 cloud and provision a bunch of VMs with IP addresses,
							then route my traffic through each one once to vote, but this will
							cost me time and money, and is difficult to further automate.
							</p>
							<p>
							What about using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>?
							Tor is an anonymity service that bounces traffic around the globe
							before sending it on to its eventual destination.
							</p>
							<p>
							We can use the handy <b>torsocks</b> utility to wrap our curl
							command and push our requests through Tor!
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="620px" src="/img/posts/contest_rigging/torsocks.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							This works just as well, and we can run it over and over again
							simply by tearing down the Tor circuit and rebuilding it between
							votes.
							</p>
							<p>
							This is where I stopped, but there's plenty of further work to do
							to turn this into a full-fledged rigging.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="220px" src="/img/posts/contest_rigging/curl_useragent.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							First, at the moment, my requests with curl all use curl's
							UserAgent string.  This is a dead giveaway that the votes are
							scripted and aren't coming from a user clicking buttons in their
							browser. If I were to continue, I would use curl's -A argument to
							pass a random UserAgent string from a 
							<a href="http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php">big list of UserAgent strings</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
							The next major issue is that currently, the script makes requests
							for the main page and the admin "cast vote" page. It doesn't
							retrieve any of the elements on the main page before casting a
							vote, such as the images of all the cute animals. A sysadmin that
							checks the web server's access logs will quickly notice a series
							of paired requests without accompanying retrievals of page
							elements (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.). This is quite
							suspicious, and makes identifying our fradulent votes very easy.
							To make our requests more realistic, we could use <b>wget</b>
							instead of curl. wget's -r option recursively pulls down all page
							elements and so would better emulate real browser behavior.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>Detection</b><br/>
							So, how could we detect or mitigate this attack?<br/>
							It probably won't be possible to get complete certainty
							about whether particular votes are fraudulent or not. However,
							there are some additional things we can do.
							<ul>
								<li>Blacklist Tor IP addresses. All Tor endpoints are public.
									We can simply blacklist them. The downside is that then
									people who are concerned about their privacy cannot vote on
									your site.</li>
								<li>Identify heuristics of suspected fraudsters, then use those
									characteristics to identify more fraudulent votes. Even
									better, automate this using machine learning. This would be
									particularly effective against the current attack that does
									not use legitimate UserAgent strings or retrieve page
									elements.</li>
								<li>Use an online account for authentication rather than the
									user's IP address. As shown in this post, it's relatively
									simple to redirect your network traffic from a variety of IP
									addresses. Fake accounts can also be created, but it is a
									much harder challenge to automate and scale. It also
									increases friction for your users who might not want to log
									into their account at the moment.</li>
							</ul>
							Ultimately, this is a tough problem, as these defenses all have
							drawbacks and take a not-insignificant amount of effort to implement.
							However, this would be a <i>great</i> exercise to practice the
							kinds of challenges that blue teams and incident responders face
							all the time.
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>A last word about ethics:</b><br/>
							I performed this project for fun, and submitted, all-in-all,
							approximately 10 votes for my Mom's picture.  This is fewer than
							the 14 or so I could have voted myself according to the rules,
							and should not affect the outcome of the contest.<br/>
							I do not condone using the techniques presented here to undermine
							the intended security precautions of any systems. I present these
							techniques so that you and I can become better security
							practitioners.<br/>
							As a final thought, in the course of this exercise I realized
							this would make a great project for a future security course.
							Both the offensive and defensive sides.
