							<h2>Evaluating the Feasibility of Autonomous Vehicle Contracts</h2>

							<h3>Presented at <a href="http://www.ieee-vnc.org">IEEE VNC 2018</a></h3>
							<h4>Abstract:</h4>
							<p>
							In Autonomous Vehicle (AV) platooning, vehicles queue up with
							minimal following distances for improved traffic density and fuel
							economy.  If one vehicle is compromised and suddenly brakes,
							these AVs will most likely be unable to prevent a collision.  In
							this work, we propose a proactive approach to platooning
							security: <i>Autonomous Vehicle contracts</i>, in which AVs are
							architected to use secure enclaves to enforce agreed-upon driving
							rules, such as a restriction not to brake harder than a certain
							threshold while the contract is in effect.  We explore whether AV
							contracts will be feasible in worst-case emergency situations
							while simultaneously under attack, when it is imperative to
							return full autonomy to AVs as soon as possible.  Through our
							prototype contract implementation using Intel SGX enclaves,
							including measurement from real-world testing of wireless
							On-Board Units (OBUs), we show that AV contracts can be quickly
							and safely terminated in the event of an emergency while
							retaining a false positive rate of under 0.001\% per 10 hours of
							use.  We find that individual autonomy can be returned to the
							vehicles of an 8-vehicle platoon under contract within 1.5
							seconds of an attack, including both detection and safe vehicle
							separation.  Smaller platoons are even quicker.  Consequently,
							automobile manufacturers may find the additional safety offered
							by AV contracts to provide a net benefit.
