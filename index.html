							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>
								Jeremy is a Staff Security Engineer on the
								Platform Security team at <a
								href="https://www.getcruise.com">Cruise</a>. For
								the past three years, he has worked on
								transforming Cruise's internal Authentication
								and Authorization layers into a unified global
								framework spanning hundreds of clusters and
								thousands of cloud applications.
								
								Previously, Jeremy was a Tech Lead at <a
								href="https://duo.com">Duo Security</a>, where
								he's worked on the next generation of
								passwordless authentication. He also worked on
								the <a href="https://duo.com/labs">Duo Labs</a>
								team, doing exploratory research on zero trust
								networking and new trust and authentication
								models. Before that, he did a brief stint as a
								Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan,
								where he achieved candidacy but decided the
								academic life was not for him.  

								His interests primarily fall under the wide
								category of network and systems security,
								with a particular focus on Authentication and Authorization technologies. 

								He received his M.S.  in Computer Science from
								the University of California, Davis, with a
								focus on Android security and privacy. He has
								previously been a researcher / developer /
								instructor at <a
								href="http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National
								Laboratories</a> in California where he ran the 
								<a
								href="http://www.sandia.gov/careers/students_postdocs/internships/institutes/cyber_defenders.html">Center
								for Cyber Defenders</a> internship program for
								several years and founded the <a
								href="https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/cyber_academy/">Cyber
								Technologies Academy</a>.  <!--<a
								href="https://share.sandia.gov/cta/">Cyber
								Technologies Academy</a>.--> He also worked on a
								bunch of other projects there, like <a

								Jeremy moved to the Seattle area in 2019 with
								his wife and now has two kids that keep him
								busier than ever. When the youngest gets old
								enough to wear a helmet, he looks forward to
								family bike rides again.
