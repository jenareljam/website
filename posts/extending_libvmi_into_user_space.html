							<h2>Extending LibVMI into User Space Applications</h2>
							<h5>April 26, 2016</h5>
							<p>
							Recently, I've been working with <a
								href="http://libvmi.com">LibVMI</a> for a course project where
							we were able to subvert the Linux kernel and OpenSSL RNGs in a
							running VM.  The general overview can be found in our class <a
							href="/static_docs/EECS588/paper.pdf">paper</a> on the projects
						page.
							</p>
							<p>
							Specifically, extending the attack from the kernel to user space
							was tricky and there really wasn't much documentation on the
							subject available online, so I wanted to document the process we
							went through. Maybe it will be helpful to someone someday.
							</p>
							<p>
							If you are interested in playing with the code yourself, you can
							get it here: <a
							href="https://github.com/jericks-umich/libvmi">GitHub</a>
							</p>
							<p>
							As a brief background of the work on this project, we started
							with the Kernel RNG attack (<a
								href="https://github.com/jericks-umich/libvmi/blob/master/examples/rng-hook_kernel_fixed.c">rng-hook_kernel_fixed.c</a>),
							which required creating a few helper constructs, such as a
							"breakpoint" struct (and helper functions).

							</figure>
							<p>
							To find a good breakpoint location, we reversed random.c, the
							kernel's random number generator, and found that random bytes
							were extracted from the entropy pool in the extract_entropy_user
							function. We can then look up the kernel memory address for the
							extract_entropy_user function and jump a fixed known offset from
							there to the instruction on which to break (line 1228 in 
							<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/char/random.c?v=4.4#L1203">random.c</a>). 
							Using GDB on random.o worked great for this.

							</figure>
							<p>
							Looks like the call to extract_buf is 155 bytes into
							extract_entropy_user, and the instruction immediately after that
							is at a 160-byte offset.
							</p>

								<figcaption>Notice the argument order. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">x86_64</a>,

							</figure>
							<p>
							After that, we simply inspect the local variables ...
							</p>
							<figure>

								<figcaption>Unfortunately, RSI get clobbered with the call to extract_buf so we have to record tmp's address beforehand.</figcaption>

							<p>
							However, extending this attack to Apache2 and OpenSSL was a bit
							of a nightmare and the real story of this post.  Completely aside
							from the fact that OpenSSL is somewhat of a mess under the hood
							and therefore difficult to reverse engineer, simply moving from
							kernel space introspection to user space introspection with
							LibVMI is difficult in its own right.
							</p>
							<p>
							To start with, we reverse engineered the Apache2 and OpenSSL
							source code to pinpoint a good code location for introspection,
							similar to the location in extract_entropy_user in the kernel
							attack above.  We found it at the <a
								href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/bn/bn_rand.c#L190">end
								of the bnrand function</a> in OpenSSL. This is where new random
							BIGNUM structs are generated and then returned for use in a
							variety of crypto applications.

							<p>
							So, let's start finding the proper offsets into the bnrand
							function for our breakpoints.

								<img width="500px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/BN_rand.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Well, bnrand is called from BN_rand, so let's look at that.

							<figure>
								<img width="500px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/bnrand_found.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							All those pushes look like the start of a function saving the
							caller's register values. Let's scroll down...

							<figure>
								<img width="500px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/bnrand_call_to_bin2bn.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Found it! So, the compiler optimized away the function call to
							bnrand (sorta).  Well, that's going to make finding this memory
							offset dynamically from LibVMI a real pain.  We'll need to start
							at the symbol for BN_rand, then read the address at BN_rand+13
							bytes (the address stored in the jmp instruction), then jump down
							572 bytes (0x7f99441e59dc - 0x7f99441e57a0) from there to find
							our breakpoint location.
							</p>
							<p>
							Okay, so we'll just use LibVMI's handy user space symbol lookup
							function to find BN_rand, do the above steps, and then everything
							will work like the kernel approach above...
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="700px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/libvmi_sym_lookup.png" />
								<figcaption>Linux is unimplemented at this time!?</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Problem #2: Our function doesn't work.
							</p>
							<p>
							So, as it turns out, because of the complexity that will shortly
							become apparent, LibVMI doesn't currently support looking up user
							space process symbols. Bummer! Well, what would it entail to do
							it manually? Is there something in the kernel's process list data
							structures that will let us go retrieve this information
							ourselves?
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="600px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/kernel_structs.png" />
								<figcaption><a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1389">task_struct</a> is a kernel data structure that stores information about a running process.

							<p>
							When the process runs, it loads (mmaps) all the dynamic libraries
							(Linux shared objects) it needs into its virtual memory. These
							libraries are loaded at unpredictable offsets. Also, when these
							libraries are linked in at run time, all the symbol references to
							functions in those libraries must be looked up as essentially a
							fixed offset from the start of the library. Thus, it makes sense
							that the symbol we're looking for (BN_rand) isn't going to be in
							some global process symbol table, but rather in a symbol table
							for the particular library.
							</p>
							<p>
							So, I can't say I feel really comfortable with this yet, but from 
							<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ali/entry/inside_elf_symbol_tables">
								reading up about how symbols are stored in ELF files</a>
							it looks like symbols can be categorized into <i>dynsym</i>
							symbols and <i>symtab</i> symbols. Dynsym symbols are the global
							symbols required to run the program and get loaded into memory
							when the binary runs, whereas symtab symbols appear to be
							<i>debugging</i> symbols, useful for getting GDB to print out
							function names, but unnecessary for runtime linking.
							</p>
							<p>
							This distinction between dynsym and symtab symbols looks
							promising because BN_rand is probably a dynsym symbol and
							therefore loaded into memory where we could dynamically grab it
							with LibVMI.  <span style="color: green;">This looks like
								something we can use to make the vmi_translate_sym2v function
								work! Let's come back to this later (as in, another later
								post).</span> 
							</p>
							<p>
							However, at this point, I made another observation: The library
							containing the BN_rand function is static, and so from the start
							of the region of the library that gets mapped into memory, the
							BN_rand function will always start at a fixed offset. Let's find
							that offset.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="660px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/BN_rand_symbol.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Great, so we've found the library Apache2 uses. This library will
							be loaded into memory into one of those purple locations in the
							Process Virtual Memory diagram above.
							</p>
							<p>
							Now let's find the offset.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="620px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/BN_rand_lib_offset.png" />
								<figcaption></figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Excellent. Since shared libraries use <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">Position-independent
								code</a>, the BN_rand function will be located <b>0xd5a50</b>
							bytes from the start of wherever this library gets mapped into
							memory.
							</p>
							<p>
							Before we proceed, let's make sure this checks out on the running
							program.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="440px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/libcrypto_memory_location.png" />
								<figcaption>Remember, the PID of our Apache2 process is 4560.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<figure>
								<img width="460px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/BN_rand_asm.png" />
								<figcaption>Same image as before. Where does BN_rand start?</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<figure>
								<img width="400px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/python_memory_math.png" />
								<figcaption>Hey, that's the same offset that we got before!</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Great. We now know the offset from the start of libcrypto.so at
							which we will find the BN_rand function, bypassing the entire
							symbol lookup.
							</p>
							<p>
							So, to review, so far we've identified:
							<ol>
								<li>we need to find the start of libcrypto.so in memory, dynamically</li>
								<li>0xd5a50 bytes from there, we find the start of BN_rand</li>
								<li>13 bytes into BN_rand, we find the address of bnrand</li>
								<li>572 bytes into bnrand, we find the call to BN_bin2bn where we want to break</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
							Guess it's time to see if we can find where the start of
							libcrypto.so is in the process's virtual memory.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="600px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/kernel_structs.png" />
								<figcaption>Same as before, just saving you from having to scroll.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							Just one more problem. Ya-know how all this code we're
							introspecting is running on the VM?  Well, what if the VM kernel
							data structures are compiled differently than the kernel data
							structures on my host machine? Dang it. Now we need the offsets
							of those structures directly from the VM. I modified the
							<a href="https://github.com/jericks-umich/libvmi/commit/58e4b4a16f57658d615bf068c6469bb0f4568e33#diff-645368f3cdbb95a177a1f382a48a0bcf">linux-offset-finder</a>
							tool that LibVMI provides to find all the offsets for those data structures.
							</p>
							<p>
							Also, did'ja know that the default seven parameters you put in
							/etc/libvmi.conf when setting up LibVMI for the first time are
							the <i>only</i> acceptable parameters?  No dynamic parameter
							support at all. So, after grabbing all the offsets from the VM, I
							just included them statically in the code and moved on.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="640px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/struct_offset_hack.png" />
								<figcaption>Feels dirty writing code like this. Looked into making LibVMI dynamic, but coming up on a deadline, skipped it. I hope to come back and update LibVMI with dynamic configuration support and push it upstream.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							So, I updated the code (using the
							<a href="https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi/blob/master/examples/process-list.c">process-list</a>
							example as a guide) to find the Apache2 process (remember, we
							don't care which one, they're all the same) and then wrote a
							function, 
							<a href="https://github.com/jericks-umich/libvmi/blob/master/examples/rng-hook_openssl.c#L420">walk_vmmap_for_lib</a>,
							to walk the kernel data structures and return the first memory
							address where libcrypto.so is loaded. (This could be extended to
							return the Nth memory address where it's loaded, but wasn't
							necessary in this case.)
							</p>
							<p>
							Following the chain of dereferences and offsets described above,
							we can find the proper place to set our breakpoint, and overwrite
							OpenSSL's RNG'd bytes with whatever we want.

							<p>
							In this case, what we want is a bunch of 0x66 bytes so it's easy
							to detect. This could just as easily be a pseudorandom stream of
							bytes generated with my public key, only predictable with my
							private key (although asymmetric crypto may impose a noticible
							performance hit, more research on that later).

								<figcaption>Wireshark, inspecting publicly-visible Diffie-Hellman key exchange parameters.</figcaption>

							<p>
							Take a moment to refresh your memory of the 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman protocol</a>.
							The server picks two public parameters, <b>p</b> and <b>g</b>.
							Each side of the communication generates a random private key,
							<b>priv</b> and passes the other their corresponding public key
							<b>pub</b>, computed by taking <b>g^priv % p</b>.  Finally, the
							session key that encrypts the rest of the TLS session is found on
							both sides by taking <b>g^(priv_A * priv_B) % p</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
							If a third-party can predict the private key of either side, then
							using parameters passed in the clear during this key exchange,
							they can compute the session key and do all sorts of bad things
							to the connection.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img width="620px" src="/img/posts/libvmi/win.png" />
								<figcaption>(g^priv % p) == pub</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
							If our attack worked, the random number OpenSSL generated for
							<b>priv</b> should have been 256 bytes of 0x66.
							</p>
							<p>
							Since taking <b>g</b> to this predicted <b>priv</b> power, modulo
							<b>p</b> does in fact compute <b>pub</b>, we have successfully
							subverted the OpenSSL RNG used in Apache2!
