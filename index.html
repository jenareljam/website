							<h2>About this Site</h2>
							<p>
							The inital template for this page was lovingly ripped off from 
							<a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar">BlackrockDigital</a> 
							under the MIT license.

							<p>
							After ripping out all the javascript and animations, what's left
							is completely static and written by hand.  It <i>should</i>
							render properly on all major browsers, including mobile browsers.
							However, Jeremy is not a web developer, and so any formatting
							errors can be safely blamed on the people who decided having no
							standard for browser rendering was a good idea.  HTML and CSS
							only, no javascript, no tracking, no analytics.  Adblock
							welcomed! (there are no ads)

							to help keep my site secure.  It's not that there's anything
							worth encrypting on my site, it's that HTTPS keeps you safe from
							things that <i>aren't</i> on my site.</p>
