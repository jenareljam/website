							<h3>Random Musings</h3>
							<p>Really not a fan of web programming, let me tell you.</p>
							<p>Why, if security is applicable to every subfield of computer science, is there only <i>one</i> undergraduate computer security course at most universities?</p>
							<p>I really need to get better at using GPG. Another grad student I once knew suggested that if I ever emailed him, I encrypt my email so we both could practice. Good advice. Want to help me practice?</p>
