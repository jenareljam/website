							<h4>Building a secure home network</h4>
							<p>
								Working with <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~alfchen/">Qi Alfred Chen</a>
								and advised by <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/">Morley Mao</a>. 
								We just submitted a proposal to Google's
								<a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.de/2016/02/announcing-google-internet-of-things.html">IoT Technology Research Award</a>.
								The idea is to provide
								<ol>
									<li>A simple and intuitive method for users to manage local device communication</li>
									<li>A secure authentication protocol for home networks to manage local devices</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<h4>Exploring entropy control in the hypervisor</h4>
							<p>
								Course project with Tim Trippel and Andrew Quinn. Exploring the Linux kernel RNG and
								entropy pool, and to what extent it can stealthily be controlled, subverted, or 
								predicted via hypervisor access.
							</p>
							<h4>IP-LED</h4>
							<p>
								Worked with Aravind Vadrevu and advised by <a href="https://jhalderm.com">Alex Halderman</a> 
								and <a href="http://www.impedimenttoprogress.com/">Matthew Hicks</a>. Designed a
								modified <a href="https://zmap.io/">ZMap</a> scanner to send signals to large IP spaces
								concurrently. Signals detected via smartphone app with image-recognition detecting
								LED blinks on home routers. Allows determination of IP address using physical
								side-channel.
							</p>
							<h4>PenTest Project for EECS 388</h4>
							<p>
								EECS 388 (the undergraduate security class) has traditionally had a networking project
								that includes a component in which the students must crack WEP encryption on a wireless
								network. I rebuilt the scenario into a PenTest in which the students are responsible for
								the first three phases of 
								<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/the-five-phases-of-a-successful-network-penetration/">
									the PenTest lifecycle
								</a>
								as they break into a WPA-encrypted wireless network and steal "sensitive company information."
								The assignment now comes complete with authorization agreement (loosely based on the 
								<a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/bestprac/writing-penetration-testing-report-33343">
									SANS Pentesting Report
								</a>) and a report due to the customer at the conclusion.

							<h3>2015</h3>
							<h4>Bring Your Own Hospital</h4>
							<p>
								Worked with <a href="https://echavisspqr.wordpress.com/">Evan Chavis</a> and advised by 
								<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/">Kevin Fu</a> and 
								<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey/">Peter Honeyman</a> to build a replica
								hospital network environment, building on 
								<a href="http://minimega.org">minimega</a> and with help and advice from our friends at
								the UM hospital. Evan did most of the heavy lifting on this one.
							</p>
							<h4>Blocking cache side channels through dynamic recompilation</h4>
							<p>
								Course project with <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~akshitha/index.html">Akshitha Sriraman</a>
								and <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sairohit/">Sai Gouravajhala</a>. 
								We designed
								a system, building on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2742212">Protean Code</a>
								and my earlier work replicating <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/yarom">FLUSH+RELOAD</a>,
								that dynamically mitigates cache side channel
								attacks in real time while under attack, but allows critical cryptographic subroutines
								to execute in a faster, insecure mode when no attack is present.
							</p>
							<h4>Secure session key leakage in QUIC</h4>
							<p>
								Course project with Ofir Weisse and Tim Trippel. We designed an alternative to
								Split TLS that uses the mechanism of leaking the session key in real-time to the
								network gateway to allow network traffic introspection while maintaining end-to-end
								encryption between the client and server.
							</p>
							<h4>Startup Project - Cache side channel attacks</h4>
							<p>
								<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/">Kevin Fu</a> had a great idea for a 
								new PhD student. Spend 4 weeks reimplementing a recent conference paper to 
								<ol>
									<li>learn something new</li>
									<li>get back into the research swing of things</li>
								</ol>
								I chose to reimplement <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/yarom">FLUSH+RELOAD</a>,
								a cool cache side-channel attack that uses instruction cache leakage instead of the
								more-common technique of analyzing data cache leakage.
