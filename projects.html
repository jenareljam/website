								This was my first foray into autonomous vehicle security.
								Building on some prior work with SGX enclaves, I had a neat
								idea.  What if, in autonomous vehicle platooning, we could get
								each vehicle to <i>agree</i> not to crash into the other
								vehicles in the platoon, and actually <i>enforce</i> that
								agreement. This turned into the idea of autonomous vehicle
								contracts. We explored the necessary consequences of forming
								these contracts in practice, which led to building a contract
								chain protocol to negotiate these contracts safely and ensure
								that, even under attack, these autonomous vehicles would remain
								safe for their passengers.  
							</p>

								I had the privilege of working with
								<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~chshibo/">Shibo Chen</a>
								and Melisa Savich on this project from the very beginning.  We
								published this work at IEEE VNC in 2018.

								This was a simple little side project I performed to evaluate
								the feasibility of reactive approaches to attacks on autonomous
								vehicle platoons.  Essentially, reactive approaches, such as
								intrusion detection, can only react as soon as they discover a
								rogue vehicle has behaved anomalously.  This will incur at
								least some short delay. When combined with differences in
								vehicle braking deceleration rates, it becomes clear that
								purely-reactive approaches to platooning safety are
								insufficient. This motivates our later work on CommPact.
							</p>
							<p>
								I built a fairly simple graph utility to display how adjusting
								different initial parameters, such as vehicle speed,
								deceleration rate, and reaction delay, impact the final
								theoretical safe following distance. All parameters can be
								adjusted via slider, and the graph shows how each parameter
								will affect the necessary following distance, given the
								currently-selected initial values.

								This project started as a way to enhance a home router to provide:
								<ol>
									<li>A simple and intuitive method for users to manage local device communication</li>
									<li>A secure authentication protocol for home networks to manage local devices</li>
								</ol>
								However, once we got into it, we realized we had actually
								created an attribution mechanism that defends against almost
								all Man-In-The-Middle attacks on local networks. Allowing users
								to restrict which of their devices are allowed to communicate
								with one another is a simple and effective access control
								technique.  However, local identifiers such as MAC and IP
								addresses can easily be spoofed by attackers, and so standard
								access control techniques are useless.  To enable these
								techniques, we bound each client device to a unique vNIC on the
								router, and then associated each packet with the vNIC it
								traversed. This solved a long-standing problem in local network
								security. Our solution is built on OpenWRT and can be easily
								built for a variety of different consumer routers. We published
								this work under the name "No one in the Middle" at AsiaCCS in
								2018.

								Course project with <a href="https://timothytrippel.com/">Tim Trippel</a>. 
								After our previous work attacking Virtual Machine RNG from the
								hypervisor, we came up with a solution using trusted hardware
								(Intel SGX) to enable applications to securely perform their
								needed crypto operations. We built a shared library that
								instantiates an SGX enclave, provisions keys for use by a TLS
								library such as OpenSSL, and provides protected crypto
								operations within the trusted enclave. This approach prevents a
								malicious OS or hypervisor from subverting the RNG.

								EECS 388 (the undergraduate security class) has traditionally had a networking project
								that includes a component in which the students must crack WEP encryption on a wireless
								network. I rebuilt the scenario into a PenTest in which the students are responsible for
								the first three phases of 
								<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/the-five-phases-of-a-successful-network-penetration/">
									the PenTest lifecycle
								</a>
								as they break into a WPA-encrypted wireless network and steal "sensitive company information."
								The assignment now comes complete with authorization agreement (loosely based on the 
								<a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/bestprac/writing-penetration-testing-report-33343">
									SANS Pentesting Report
								</a>) and a report due to the customer at the conclusion.
