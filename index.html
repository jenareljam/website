							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>
								Jeremy is a Tech Lead at 
								<a href="https://duo.com/labs">Duo Labs</a>, where he's working
								on the next generation of zero trust networking and
								passwordless authentication. He recently did a brief stint as a
								Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, where he achieved
								candidacy but decided the academic life was not for him.  His
								interests primarily fall under the wide category of network
								and systems security, although he has also done work in the
								cloud, mobile, IoT, and autonomous vehicle areas. He received
								his M.S. in Computer Science from the University of California,
								Davis, with a focus on Android security and privacy. He has
								previously been a researcher / developer / instructor at 
								<a href="http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a> 
								in California where he ran the 
								<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/careers/students_postdocs/internships/institutes/cyber_defenders.html">Center for Cyber Defenders</a>
								internship program for several years and founded the 
								<a href="https://share-ng.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/cyber_academy/">Cyber Technologies Academy</a>.
								<!--<a href="https://share.sandia.gov/cta/">Cyber Technologies Academy</a>.-->
								He also worked on a bunch of other projects, like 
								<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/100618.html">FARM</a>
								and 
								<a href="http://minimega.org">minimega</a>. 
								He is known for sending "donut" emails from any unlocked and
								unattended computer. You've been warned.
